Lately I have been playing around with Apple Script Editor to automate some tasks on my OSX device. Descriptions and links are below if you find these useful or want to test:

* [Disable OSX Dashboard]()
* [Remove INET Downloads]()

To install, download each zip file above, extract the contents and copy to '''~/Library/Scripts'''.
Make sure to activate the menu option in Script Editor Preferences if you haven't already.
All scripts currently work with OSX v10.10 and below.
