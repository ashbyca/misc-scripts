This script basically performs large lookups and writes all the information to a results file. It’s basic but works great, it’s intended to work on any Windows computer.

Prior to use, the following modifications will need to be made:

1. Change the value with the absolute path where the script is located
2. Change ns1 and ns2 to include your DNS servers
3. Change the endpoint1 and endpoint2 values to include the hostnames you wish to perform a lookup against

After you save the file, execute the script. Once completed, you will have a txt file that contains the complete results. Any error's will be displayed in the command window.
